# About


Greetings! My name is Qi Zeng (曾琪). 

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), under the supervision of Professor Heng Ji. Prior to UIUC, I got my bachelor's degree from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research interests lie in the general area of Natural Language Processing, especially in knowledge-aware language understanding and representation.
